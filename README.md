# PS4RC

## Goal
To connect a PS4 controller as a student to an RC transmitter using ESP32.

## Idea
The idea behind the project is to make an affordable second controller for an RC model that can function as a student controller in a teacher/student scenario. The primary audience of this project are probably people who do not have multiple transmitters and receivers to connect them together, but have a friend or a child who wants to fly a model, but needs assistance.

## Features
- Wireless student controller
- SBUS integration. With most of the radios (like TX16S)
- SRXL2 integration. With Spektrum radios (like DXS)

## Roadmap/Future ideas
- Configuration without compilation.
- Compiled binaries. Ready to flash, no need to compile.
- Bluetooth pairing.
- Connection via external rf module pins. 
  Many radios feature a bay for an external rf module. If not in use, itâ€™s handy to store and connect the PS4RC module.
